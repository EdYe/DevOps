The homework of DevOps team

1. Use Linux Server install apache/nginx (http server) and using virtual host show phpinfo page using PHP code (Ubuntu better, other distrbuation also okay) HINT: you can use any domain you want, just write the domain name to hosts file, then you can verify at local machine. Target: using browser in the machine or curl can see the phpinfo page with you specify domain name, and take the screen shot. 

Optional work (Bonus, free to answer)

1. Using free AWS account and point a DNS name to your apache/nginx (http) server and show your application, the application can use first question showing phpinfo or any application you want to use. HINT: you can use twbbs.org or dot.tk or any free domain vender you found, you can register a free domain name there.

2. Containerize question 1 VM/Machine as a container image. Target: we can just run up the image then can access the apache/nginx (http) server (If can using Chef/Ansible to deploy will be better)

Note,
1. Check in your any configure (e.g Apache configure, index.php, Docker file) to Github
